Dependencies:
- PVS 6.0 (http://pvs.csl.sri.com/download.shtml)
- Nasalib 6.0.10 (https://github.com/nasa/pvslib, development version)
- Dedukti 2.5 (http://dedukti.gforge.inria.fr/)
- MetiTarski 2.4 (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~lp15/papers/Arith/)

Installation:
- Install all dependencies, ensure that PVS, Dedukti, and MetiTarski are indexed in the PATH
- Clone this project into a new directory
- Add the following line to ~/.bashrc
export PVS_WITH_PROOFS_PATH= full path of the directory where the files have been placed
- Run make

To test the generation of proof certificates (.proof files) with the ints library
- Go to the directory ints
- Run pvs, go to the buffer *pvs*, run (load-pvs-with-proofs)
- Run (pvs-with-proofs-dir)
- The proofs are printed as ".proof" files

To test the export to Dedukti and MetiTarski with the induction theory
- Go to the directory induction
- Run pvs, go to the buffer *pvs*, run (load-pvs-with-proofs)
- Run (pvs-with-proofs "induction" 'nat_sum t t)
- The dedukti certificates is induction.dk, the input for MetiTarski is induction.p
- To check the dedukti certificate: dkcheck induction.dk
- To prove the generated assumptions with MetiTarski: metit induction.p

To test an arbitrary theory
- Go to the directory containing this theory
- Run pvs, go to the buffer *pvs*, run (load-pvs-with-proofs)
- Run either
   * (pvs-with-proofs "theory-name") to generate certificates for all theorems in the theory
   * (pvs-with-proofs "theory-name" 'theorem-name) for a specific theorem
